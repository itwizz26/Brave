# Brave Digital
Earthquake Catalog API

## Installation

To properly use the WP Brave Digital theme and Earthquake Catalog API plugin, first download/clone the theme into your WP themes directory and activate it.
Run this command inside the new theme directory (which should be 'brave-digital') to add the required PHP composer package dependancies.
```composer install```

Once completed, then copy the plugin into the plugins directory of your working WordPress site and activate it in the Admin panel.

When activated, the plugin will create a page called 'Earthquake Catalog'. Open this page to view earthquake data for the past 1 hour.

Happy blogging!
