# Brave
Earthquake Catalog API

## Installation

To properly use the WP Brave Digital theme and Earthquake Catalog API plugin, first download/clone the theme into your WP themes directory and activate it.
Run this command inside the new theme (which should be brave-digital) to add the PHP composer package dependancies.
```composer install```

Once completed, then clone the plugin inside the plugins directory in your working WordPress site and activate it in the Admin panel of your WP site.

When activated, the plugin will create a page called Earthquake Catalog. Open this page to view earthquake data for the past 1 hour.

Happy blogging!
